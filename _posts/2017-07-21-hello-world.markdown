Welcome to my first blog post. My name is Crossley and I am currently a computer science student who wants to learn as much as possible about Software Development.

So why am I creating a blog?

+ To explain concepts and topics on Computer Science so that I can become a better Developer.
+ Something to keep me busy.
+ Practice my writing skills.

What am I going to be talking about?

+ Programming topics like Algorithms, Data Structures, etc.
+ Topics I am currently learning like Android Development.
+ Projects I might be working on.

So with that little introduction, I welcome you to my journey as a Software Developer.
